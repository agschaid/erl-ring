# erl-ring
Just a bit of exercise code.

Looking for a little erlang exercise I stumbled upon Joe Armstrongs challange:

*"Write a ring benchmark. Create N processes in a ring.
Send a message round the ring M times so that a total of N * M messages get sent.
Time how long this takes for different values of N and M."*

In this repo I will try various ways (plain erlang, OTP-based, Elixir,...) to tackle the challenge and iterativly ehnance them as I grow better ;)
